It is thought to make a map of all Armenian regions with Cities to point out the number of Corona-virus of region and city.
However, right now there is no info of the cities and regions.
When there will be such information the locations will be updated.

The information show on the map is the date and the number of entire Armenian Corona-virus infected people.
